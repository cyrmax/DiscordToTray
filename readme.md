# Discord to Tray

A small NVDA add-on which minimizes Discord window to system tray instead of closing it with alt+f4 hotkey.

Warning! The add-on just does the same as close button in the top of Discord main window. For minimizing to work correctly you should enable this feature in Windows settings of Discord.
